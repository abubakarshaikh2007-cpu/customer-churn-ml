📊 Customer Churn Prediction – Machine Learning Project

📌 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict customer churn using telecom customer data.

The goal is to identify customers who are likely to leave the company so that businesses can take preventive retention actions.

🎯 Business Problem

Customer churn directly impacts revenue.
If we can predict which customers are likely to churn:

We can target them with retention offers

Reduce revenue loss

Improve customer lifetime value


This project focuses on building a classification model to predict churn (Yes/No).
